ZumoExamples is a "dummy" library that does not provide any classes or functions, but it serves as a collection of example sketches that aren't specific to any of the other Zumo Shield libraries. These examples can be accessed through *File > Examples > ZumoExamples* in the Arduino enviornment, and documentation for each example can be found in the "Example projects" section of the "Zumo Shield user's guide":http://www.pololu.com/docs/0J57.
